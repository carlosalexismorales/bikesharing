# Citi Bikesharing_Challenge

Using Tableau to conduct an analysis of NYC CitiBike bikesharing data from August 2019

## Project Overview

The purpose of this project was to use Tableau to create effective visualizations and analyze bikeshare data from CitiBike in New York City for a presentation to investors looking to begin a similar bikeshare program in Des Moines, Iowa. In order to help the investors come to a decision, this analysis and visual presentation helps answer some key questions using data points such as usertype, usage durations, and peak usage times. Some of the key questions are as follows: 

-  Who participates in the bikesharing program?
-  How often are the bikes used?
-  When are they used the most and least? 


## Challenge Overview

1. Import data into Tableau.
2. Format the data to create and style worksheets, dashboards, and stories in Tableau.

The image below shows one of the sheets in the Tableau story: Checkout Times for Users. The line graph shown illustrates how there is a steep dropoff in number of rides over an hour in length.

The image below shows one of the sheets in the Tableau story: Checkout Times by Gender. The line graph below indicates the checkout times broken down by gender. This can give us an idea of which demographic has been more active with their bike usage.

The image below shows one of the sheets in the Tableau story: Trips by Weekday per Hour. The  heatmap below illustrates the  weekly usage (trips)  patterns. The legend indicates just how much usage there is by color - the closer the color is to red the heavier the usage is.

The image below shows one of the sheets in the Tableau story: Trips by Gender (Weekday per Hour). This heat map shows the usage (trips) by gender during weekday per hour. This graph gives us more detail on how often a specific gender takes trips - giving us a comparison between them.  We can see that the Male gender is predominantly taking more trips.

The image below shows one of the sheets in the Tableau story: User Trips by Gender by Weekday. This heat map shows how heavy the usage is (trips) during the days of the week by usertrips between the genders. This heat map reinforces what has previously been shown - the male gender predominately makes up much of the userbase, specifically subscribers.

The image below shows one of the sheets in the Tableau story: August Peak Hours. This bar graph illustrates the number of bikes rides during each hour of the day. We can see that between the hours of 2am and 5am -  this is ideal for bike repairs and redistribution since there is very little bike usage.

The image below shows one of the sheets in the Tableau story: Bike Repairs. This stepped-level heat map shows us bike ids sorted by size, color, and its degree of usage. The closer and bigger it is to red, the more usage there has been and the more likely that the bike will need repairs more often than not.  The smaller and closer it is to green, the lower the usage, indicating there might not be any repairs or replacements being made.

## Summary and Additional Analysis


Ultimately, bikeshare services are remarkably popular in dense  metropolitan area. The user base is predominantly made up of male subscribers, providing regular income to the program. More focus should pivoted towards female rides. The main usage time appears to be around morning and evening commute times.


The following images below will be used for additional analyses: 


RideSharing Locations (Starting and Ending) by Gender: This sheet shows that males prefer to start and end their trips away from the center of the city as opposed to females, indicating that perhaps a geographical analysis can provide more insight as to why this is occurring.
