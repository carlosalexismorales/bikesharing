# Citi Bikesharing_Challenge

Using Tableau to conduct an analysis of NYC CitiBike bikesharing data from August 2019

## Project Overview

The purpose of this project was to use Tableau to create effective visualizations and analyze bikeshare data from CitiBike in New York City for a presentation to investors looking to begin a similar bikeshare program in Des Moines, Iowa. In order to help the investors come to a decision, this analysis and visual presentation helps answer some key questions using data points such as usertype, usage durations, and peak usage times. Some of the key questions are as follows: 

-  Who participates in the bikesharing program?
-  How often are the bikes used?
-  When are they used the most and least? 


## Challenge Overview

1. Import data into Tableau.
2. Format the data to create and style worksheets, dashboards, and stories in Tableau.
